## Profiler

The profiling meta-framework we're building currently focuses on two key aspects

1. Relative CPU speed: we use the time to execute a simple bash script.

2. Network position: we ping all of the listed endpoints for relative network distance.

All of this is then posted to the profile server, which is accessible by clients.
